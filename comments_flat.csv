V_xro1bcAuA,"(In case anybody had this question from the linear regression model) ~ 6:49:00
How does the loss function keep track of which model it is for? This question stems from loss_fn itself is not defined in a way that conects it to a model(e.g. nn.MSELoss) and also loss itself is calculated only on training ourputs and predicted outputs. (loss = loss_fn(y_pred, y_train)). 

In PyTorch, whenever you perform operations on tensors (like a forward pass through a model), a computational graph is created. This graph records the operations and the relationships between tensors (like which tensors were used to create a new tensor).  In this graph, tensors are nodes, and operations are edges. When you do a forward pass, say y_pred = model_0(X_train), it creates a part of the graph where y_pred is connected to the parameters of model_0 and the input X_train.

When you call loss.backward(), PyTorch traverses this graph backward from the loss node. It calculates the gradient of loss with respect to each tensor that has requires_grad=True.If loss was calculated from outputs of model_0, the computational graph links the loss to model_0's parameters. Therefore, loss.backward() computes gradients for model_0's parameters.",42,2023-12-30T23:36:21Z,False,

V_xro1bcAuA,"5:25:43 The reason as to why you got the same value is because of how IPython and randomness work.
So, if anyone wondering:
Computers aren't built for randomness and they can't just generate a random number. So instead they are generating quasi-random numbers based on a seed. Basically, just applying a series of mathematical operations on a ""seed"" to get a number. Then, generated number becomes new seed.
Now what is happening here: as you will get the same ""random"" number from the same seed, that means next seed will be the same as previous generation. This means with the same seed you are getting same series of numbers!
IPython (Interactive Python) is basically just running program. And it saves the seed. It means that after generating those  2 tensors you will get the seed for generating number 0.2345 EVERY time.  BUT, if you continue to generate, number will be gone.
Simple way to test this is to reset the seed (42), regenerate those tensors and generate the number again. It will be 0.2345. If they hadn't changed randomness algorithm by the time you are reading this.",5,2024-07-01T09:12:53Z,False,

V_xro1bcAuA,"a simple analogy to explain how PyTorch's autograd system and the optimizer work together:

Imagine you're painting a picture, and you have a friend who's giving you advice on how to improve it. Your painting process is like the forward pass in a neural network, and your friend's advice is like the gradients in backpropagation.

Building the Picture (Forward Pass): As you paint (process your data through the model), you're making decisions about colors and shapes (weights and biases in the model). Every stroke you make with your brush affects the final picture.

Getting Feedback (Calculating Gradients with loss.backward()): Once you finish a version of your painting, your friend looks at it and gives you feedback on each part of the picture (this is like calculating the gradients). Your friend writes down this feedback on sticky notes and sticks them on the respective parts of the painting. These sticky notes are like the .grad attributes in PyTorch - they are attached to the specific parts (parameters) they refer to.

Making Adjustments Based on Feedback (optimizer.step()): Now, it's time to improve the painting based on the feedback. You go over each sticky note and adjust the painting accordingly. You don't need your friend to tell you the feedback again because it's all written on the sticky notes directly on the painting. In PyTorch, the optimizer (like optim.SGD) does this by looking at the .grad (sticky notes) on each parameter and adjusting those parameters to make the model (painting) better.

Clearing the Feedback for the Next Round (optimizer.zero_grad()): Before you start painting again (processing the next batch of data), you remove all the sticky notes (clear the gradients), so you can get new, fresh feedback for your next improvements. If you didn't remove them, you'd have old feedback mixed with new, which would be confusing.",11,2023-11-30T19:01:04Z,False,
V_xro1bcAuA,"3:50:15 I think the problem with the seed is not it only work once, but the random function will keep the last calculated value as the seed, (which is how with the default seed they manage to have different random results every time). Therefore, calling manual_seed again simply reset the seed, as well as the function to the desired values",10,2023-05-05T05:07:36Z,False,
V_xro1bcAuA,"The random seed in PyTorch sets the starting point for the generation of a sequence of random numbers. By setting a random seed, we make the entire chain of future generated random values predictable. The claim that torch.manual_seed is only applicable to the first generated value is incorrect.

Here's a good piece of code that demonstrates this:

```RANDOM_SEED = 42
torch.manual_seed(RANDOM_SEED)

random_tensor1 = torch.rand(2, 3)
random_tensor2 = torch.rand(2, 3)

torch.manual_seed(RANDOM_SEED)
random_tensor3 = torch.rand(2, 3)
random_tensor4 = torch.rand(2, 3)

print(random_tensor2 == random_tensor4)

It took me probably about a 1-1.5 months.

Daniel, I want to say thank you. 

To anyone thinking of taking this course, it doesn't matter your current skill level. He doesn't assume that you know how to do something, he shows you exactly how to get started in Colab and all basics and progress you to advanced. 

He provides an enormous amount of resources that he has created as support for you. He continuously reiterates where to find them. He uses many call backs to other scripts you write within this course helping you link and understand the code and context. I believe this course is perfect for almost every learning type whether you are (visual, auditory or tactile aka learning by doing) it covers everything.

This course is more thorough and complete then honestly any course I had taken in my 5 years of college. 



I am going to continue to pursue DL/ML through here and personal research. 

I will be purchasing the remaining courses on zero to mastery, which I normally would not do; However This course simply is that good! and I would love to support you continuing to put out this level of content!

Fa_V9fP2tpU,"8:01 feature engineering very important. Can distinguish a good ML model from a poor model. It helps model focus on relevant patterns. Ex: instead of date like 17/05/2023 we can create features as Day of week Holiday?
In ML we have to do feature engineering but in deep learning no need to do feature selection or engineering 

9:10 dimension reduction done because of curse of dimensionality-as features and data grows, it grows sparse and patterns are harder to find

11:16 model complexity like linear model too simple because only 2 parameters

12:31 as we increase the polynomial from linear to quadratic for ex, it can fit curves

Undercutting is called bias because it doesn‚Äôt accurately capture the pattern. It generalises the pattern hence it‚Äôs biased. Too general like stereotypes. Hence fails to capture complex patterns

Bias happens when for example we use a linear model to model relationships that are not linear 

Variance (overfitting) is also bad because it may capture noise in data as patterns. The ML model learns the noise. 
Variance bad with new test data.

R6u5EBWAssY,"@@johnwig285 Yes, a data engineer should be cleaning up the data. But in my experience:

1. Many ‚Äúdata‚Äù engineers are ‚Äúprocess‚Äù engineers with little understanding of the data.  I.e., if their cleanup process runs, then the data is good. 

2. Many senior managers and data customers think that the data presented to them is in roughly the same for as the source data. I.e., they don‚Äôt realize that many datasets are the combination of multiple source sub-datasets. All of which need to be clean. 

3. Data engineers need to understand the business meaning of the data that they are scrubbing. Many companies have different businesses with different categories of customers THAT DO NOT MIX.  Understanding those categories, identifying the parameters of each category, and accurately categorizing each customer into the correct category is CRITICAL.  Without understanding the business meaning of their data, how is a data engineer going to clean the data?

4. In the real world outside of a lab, all data needs to be scrubbed and not just a sample. And this data needs to be live data, not manually created data for modeling. To be sure, some data elements need to be secured for privacy.  But the semantics canNOT be corrupted. Uniqueness,cardinality, nullability, domain, etc. must be maintained. 

In one project, the compass position of a customer was a critical identifier.  Unfortunately a database engineer determined that NULLS would not be allowed in the database. I.e., it was a ‚Äúdirty‚Äù condition.  The rule was that all NULLS must be converted to a 0.  So they bounced a a dataset that I had scrubbed back to me, screaming 
‚ÄúCOVERT NULLS TO ZERO‚Äù!

I fought that but lost. It turns out that the data was poor, and customer compass position was NULL for something like 90% of customers. After replacing all those NULLS with zero, the database engineers were happy and my dataset was deemed ‚Äúgood‚Äù. That until the end users saw the data. The went ballistic saying, ‚Äúhow can 90% of customers be True North?!?‚Äù (0 degrees on the compass). 

So instead of identifying an issue that could be addressed, the data was corrupted because there was no way of separating the plugged 0‚Äôs from the rows where the customer WAS due North.  

This is a true story, not a fictional story to make a point. Unfortunately it‚Äôs an example of what the real world is like. Arrogance, incompetence, politics, and ignorance is out there.  Technical competence is not good enough.  A good data engineer has to know a lot more",0,2024-06-10T14:37:36Z,True,UgzWzTPdC5uY2yWzPF54AaABAg

The biggest problem is that virtually all consumers of data do not understand how truly horrible the source data is. And how difficult it is to cleanse and manipulate the data to into a format that is useful.  (That includes most other technical people too.)

Most people thought that I was a software developer because I programmed in something like 8-9 procedural and set-based languages. But, when asked, I told them that I was a ‚Äúdata guy‚Äù. Most did not understand what I meant. They only saw the outside of what I did and not that all the tools and techniques were the means to get good data and information. 

The final result was maybe 5% of the effort. The grunt work was 95%. But that was OK to me. It was satisfying grunt work.

Calculator says it's been 3 months and 1 week, don't care actually, cause I've written down the whole code, which author showed. The only problem is that I hardly remember the start of the course. 
My tip for those who are only starting this course: if you have an error that brakes your entire code, and you struggle with it for days instead of actually learning, just use the author's colab code from the link in the description. It's a waste of time that isn't worth it, trust my word, I had a plenty of them. 

Value your time.

jGwO_UgTS7I,"This video on machine learning is an absolute gem! It beautifully captures the essence of this transformative field and showcases the incredible power and potential it holds. As someone fascinated by the intersection of data and technology, I found this video to be both informative and inspiring.

The video did an excellent job of explaining the fundamental concepts of machine learning in a clear and concise manner. From supervised and unsupervised learning to neural networks and deep learning, it covered a wide range of topics, making it accessible to both beginners and those with some background in the field.

The real-life examples and applications of machine learning were truly captivating. Seeing how it can be used to recognize patterns, make predictions, and provide valuable insights across various industries like healthcare, finance, and marketing was mind-blowing. It's amazing to witness how machine learning algorithms can analyze vast amounts of data and extract meaningful information to drive innovation and improve decision-making.

The video also touched upon the ethical considerations surrounding machine learning, emphasizing the importance of responsible and unbiased use of these algorithms. It's crucial to be aware of the potential biases that can exist in data and to strive for fairness and transparency in the development and deployment of machine learning models. This reminder of the ethical dimensions added depth and thoughtfulness to the video's content.

I truly appreciate the effort put into creating this video. The visuals, animations, and explanations were top-notch, making complex concepts easier to grasp. It's evident that the creator has a deep understanding of machine learning and a talent for effectively communicating it to a broader audience.

Whether you're a beginner seeking an introduction to machine learning or someone looking to deepen their knowledge, this video is a must-watch.

ovIykchkW5I,"NEAT is pretty neat... (*groan*) One problem with it is that it often throws away good solutions because the mutation can often be quite aggressive and throw out long-term positive traits for short-term gains. That said: This is literally how real-world genetic evolution works too. So for this algorithm, it pays #1 to have bigger population sizes, #2 to be careful about your mutation rate, and #3 to give it enough time to run. In all experiments I did with it, it often reaches a plateau where not much happens for many generations, but after a long time, it suddenly starts improving again. I'm pretty sure it has to do with the ""species"" system it uses: Often, one species is so good at what it does, that even ""geniuses"" in other species don't have enough impact to lift their otherwise mediocre species above the king of the hill species. This can lead to situations, where species with the potential to become the new best species die out before ever getting the chance to reach their full potential. So, like I said: It works just like natural genetic evolution... A species doesn't automatically survive just because it is fitter. There also have to be the right set of random circumstances to allow them to succeed. 
P.S.: One interesting experiment you can do with NEAT is to have to mutation rate ALSO me a trait that can be mutated. That leads to some low-mutation species that keep SLOWLY improving their positive traits and several high-mutation species that keep trying out random stuff. This stops a typical problem in machine learning: The algorithm settling in a ""just-good-enough"" plateau instead of keeping to improve in the hopes of finding an ""even better"" plateau further down the line.",243,2023-03-04T14:33:51Z,False,

VMj-3S1tku0,"- 00:00:00 üéì Andre introduces the lecture on deep neural network training, focusing on a hands-on approach using a Jupyter notebook.  
- 00:00:55 ‚öô Micrograd is presented as an autograd engine that implements backpropagation, essential for training neural networks by minimizing loss functions.  
- 00:01:37 üß© Micrograd allows users to build mathematical expressions with operations like addition, multiplication, and power raising through a value object system.  
- 00:02:34 üîÑ Backpropagation enables the evaluation of derivatives with respect to inputs, providing insights into how changes in inputs affect the output.  
- 00:03:59 üìà Understanding derivatives helps in tuning weights during neural network training, indicating how each input influences the output value.  
- 00:06:04 üìù Micrograd's implementation is simple, consisting of just over 100 lines of code for the core engine and minimal lines for the neural network library.  
- 00:08:12 üåê This lecture aims to provide a clear conceptual understanding of derivatives, crucial for comprehending neural network functionality.  
- 00:12:24 üìä The derivative is defined as the slope of the function, and can be approximated numerically using a small change in input (h).  
- 00:18:56 üîó The importance of maintaining expression graphs is highlighted for neural networks, which consist of interconnected mathematical expressions.  
- 00:22:50 üèó The creation of a ""value"" class facilitates operations among values while also tracking dependencies within the expression graph.  

- 23:04 üß© New variable `prev` stores the set of children in the micrograd structure for efficiency.
- 24:14 üîÑ Operations are tracked using a simple string indicating whether the value is from addition or multiplication.
- 25:00 üìä Visualization of expressions is done using the `drawdot` function to graphically represent mathematical relationships.
- 29:11 ‚ûï Forward pass computes output from inputs, producing output value `l` based on previous values.
- 30:50 üìà The gradient (`grad`) represents the effect of value changes on output, initialized to zero for all nodes.
- 32:02 üîÑ Manual backpropagation begins by calculating initial gradients starting from the output value.
- 38:16 üîó Understanding gradients for each node is crucial for effective backpropagation and training of neural networks.
- 44:03 üìö The chain rule is crucial for determining how changes in intermediate node values affect the final output gradient.

- 00:48:54 üîÑ Derivatives are calculated as part of the backpropagation process, with a focus on specific values for 'a' and 'b'.

- 00:50:30 üìà Backpropagation involves recursively applying the chain rule from the output back through the computation graph.

- 00:51:44 üßÆ Nudge inputs in the direction of the gradient to optimize the outcome, demonstrating a single optimization step.

- 00:53:10 üß† The neuron model consists of weighted inputs, biases, and an activation function that transforms the output.

- 00:54:34 ‚öô The activation function, such as tanh, smoothly limits outputs to a defined range, influencing the model's predictions.

- 00:56:58 üìä Understanding that only the local derivative is essential to adjusting weights and biases during optimization.

- 01:00:06 üîç The tanh activation function requires the implementation of exponentiation for proper calculation within the model.

- 01:03:54 üìâ The local derivative of tanh is calculated using its defined mathematical formula, critical for backpropagation.

- 01:04:45 üì¶ Backpropagation allows gradients to flow through nodes based on operations like multiplication and addition.

- 01:09:17 ‚ö° Transitioning to a more automated backward pass approach helps simplify the backpropagation process across the neural network.

- 01:14:38 üéØ Gradients are initialized with a value of 1.0 to start backpropagation.  
- 01:18:16 üîÑ Topological sorting organizes computation graphs ensuring dependencies are processed before backpropagation.  
- 01:21:30 üõ† A backward method is implemented to automate gradient calculations for backpropagation in neural networks.  
- 01:25:28 üö´ Gradient overwriting occurs when a variable is reused multiple times; accumulation is necessary to fix it.  
- 01:28:05 ‚ûó Division can be implemented through exponentiation, transforming the operation into a multiplication of powers.  
- 01:30:08 üßÆ Implementing power functions allows for more complex operations and backpropagation through various mathematical functions.  
- 01:36:12 üîó Subtraction is handled by defining it as negation and implementing negation through multiplication by -1.  
- 01:38:43 üìä The exercise demonstrated that breaking down functions like tanh into simpler components retains mathematical equivalence in both forward and backward passes.  

- 01:38:56 üîÑ Understanding that the essence of operations in neural networks is about inputs and outputs, regardless of their complexity.
- 01:39:11 ‚öô PyTorch allows building complex operations through a tensor-based framework, enabling efficient deep learning.
- 01:39:40 üìä Scalars in Micrograd are replaced with tensors in PyTorch, which are n-dimensional arrays enhancing computational efficiency.
- 01:40:21 ‚úÖ Tensors in PyTorch must explicitly require gradients for proper training, as they default to not requiring them for efficiency.
- 01:41:03 üìà Performing arithmetic operations in PyTorch is analogous to Micrograd, maintaining a similar data access pattern.
- 01:44:08 üß† Neural networks can be viewed as specific mathematical expressions, enabling structured implementation.
- 01:45:32 ‚ö° Constructing a neuron involves initializing weights and biases, followed by implementing the forward process through multiplication and addition.
- 01:48:02 üèó A layer of neurons operates independently, with each neuron receiving inputs and producing outputs without interconnectivity.
- 01:49:41 üîó An entire multi-layer perceptron (MLP) processes inputs through sequential layers, allowing for complex data transformations.
- 01:50:56 üìâ Loss is a critical metric for measuring neural network performance and guides the adjustment of weights to improve predictions.
- 02:02:22 üìâ Gradient descent is implemented by adjusting weights in the direction opposite to the gradient, minimizing the loss effectively.
- 02:03:16 ‚öñ Minimizing loss is crucial, requiring adjustments in the negative direction of the gradient.
- 02:04:44 üìâ Regularly re-evaluating loss during the forward and backward passes helps track performance improvements.
- 02:05:58 üîÑ Repeating the forward and backward passes iteratively improves neural network predictions through gradient descent.
- 02:06:48 üö´ Too large learning rates can destabilize training, potentially causing the loss to increase rather than decrease.
- 02:08:00 ‚öô Tuning the learning rate is a delicate process; an inappropriate rate can lead to slow convergence or unstable training.
- 02:10:36 üîç Identifying and fixing common bugs in neural network code is essential for successful training.
- 02:12:28 üìù Resetting gradients (zero grad) before each backward pass is crucial for ensuring correct gradient computation.
- 02:14:52 üß† Neural networks can handle complex tasks by iteratively minimizing the loss function, driven by gradient descent principles.
- 02:16:32 üìä The principles of neural network training remain the same across various architectures, such as GPT, despite differences in complexity and detail.
- 02:21:13 üîç Micrograd allows for a simplified approach to understanding neural network operations compared to more complex libraries like PyTorch.",7,2024-08-16T12:41:54Z,False,

Just in case anybody else struggles with this ... I had a hard time wrapping my head around how the backpropagation functions work for the respective operations in the Value class. For example the def __add__(self, other) adds the _backward function that sets ""self.grad = 1.0 * out.grad"". When the function _backward is explicitly called it does not set the values for the instance itself but for the children, even though the function definition in the value class says 'self'. I figured the reason is that at class instantiation time e.g. when we execute c=a*b, self and other are set as references to a and b respectively while out references c. These references are stored in the out object the operation returns. So when c._backward() is called explicitly at a later point in time self refers to the 'child' of c as the reference was created when we ran c=a*b.",3,2023-05-10T23:13:43Z,False,

In reality, the firing of a human neuron‚Äîwhile binary in the sense of action potential‚Äîcarries a complexity modulated by neurotransmitter types and concentrations, similar to how ANNs adjust signal strength through weights, biases, and activation functions. This modulation allows for a spectrum of signal strengths, challenging the strict ""all or none"" interpretation.

a representation of a self and the representations that modulate that self

It doens't take in to concideration the artists qualms with that it can copy a certain style from an artist and then be used to make images for a company for a fraction of the cost and zero credibility to the artist, basicly making something that they have tried to monitize, with creative directivity and skill, futile since someone can essentially copy their ideas, make money off of it, and not paying for something that was for sale. Artists have a right to say how their work is being used, such as refraining from that someone uses their art without their permission. A style like a watercolour cannot really be plagarized, neither can chords in music, nor a genre of film, but you can take someones script, pretty much use it and change a few things here and there, and that would be considered plagarizm.
The main concern as I understand it is that it can be used in a way that would undermine the artists work, by pretty much taking from them and then making them obsolete.

1aM1KYvl4Dw,"I don't know if you are missing the point on purpose in your segment about copying and plagiarism, but for what it's worth, here is why the examples you gave are invalid comparisons.

First, you compared AI generated images with fan-art done in similar styles as if these are the same thing.  The thing about fan art is that a) it takes time and effort to create and b) it is a tribute to the original work.  Fan tribute art is a reinterpretation of other art that increases visibility and awareness of the original artwork,  It is a labor of love and is not capable of mass production.  This type of art does not threaten the original artist and, if anything, serves as a promotion and validation of the original work.  The AI version, on the other hand, can crank out hundreds or thousands of copycat images in seconds without attribution or acknowledgement of the inspirational source artwork.  It is this mass-production aspect, the absence of time and effort which, when coupled with the absence of attribution, transforms the output from being a tribute to being a threat.  A musician will be honored when a band covers their song but not when a computer generates a sound-alike clone in their voice or style.

Then there is the NYT comparison and once again, the key differentiator is ATTRIBUTION.  In the examples given, the original article was explicitly cited by the referencing publications as is standard journalistic practice.  To leverage the reporting of other people with attribution is an act that spreads knowledge while respecting the work that went into researching and writing the original piece.  But, to mix it all up in an un-attributed algorithmic training database and spit the information out as if it magically appeared in the world without actual humans doing actual research is a completely different thing.  

By your own explanation, AI is nothing but a very sophisticated collection of pattern recognition and pattern generation technologies that do nothing without training input.  The training input is actual human work.  That human work is being repurposed, for commercial gain, without attribution at industrial scale.  To pretend this is comparable to fan art or traditional citation and attribution by reporters is disingenuous at best.",1,2024-05-14T18:12:17Z,False,

sJXn4Cl4oww,What did you like about this video? What can we improve?!,86,2024-01-24T14:47:16Z,False,
sJXn4Cl4oww,"Firstly, I wanted to say--I can't believe I just realized I wasn't subscribed to your channel; this mistake has been rectified!

Secondly, I could easily write an essay (or more accurately, a love letter) about this channel: there are very few insightful AI channels on YouTube, a few mediocre ones, and the rest.  This channel, without a doubt, is in a league of its own.  As an engineer, when I see a new MLST video posted, it's like sitting down for a mouthwatering gourmet meal, after being forced fed nothing but junk food for weeks on end.

Finally, with that said, allow me to attempt a justification of my admiration:

1) Guests: You always have amazing guests!  Your interview style never fails to engender engaging, thoughtful, and most of all ‚Äì fun conversations! In this video in particular, Simon seems like he‚Äôs having a blast speaking about something he‚Äôs passionate about, and that enthusiasm genuinely put a smile on my face.

2) Editing: The videos are always well put together and the production value is always phenomenal!  I mean, wow‚Ä¶ Compared to the other AI channels on YouTube, Machine Learning Street Talk makes them look like amateurs. 

3) Knowledge: Most other channels seem content to merely discuss the latest ML hype as it happens in real-time; this is fine, and most aren‚Äôt objectively wrong, however, it's mostly surface level discussion and smacks of novice insight.  They are, for lack of a better description, an animated news feed.  With the exception of Yannic, MLST is the only other mainstream channel I‚Äôm aware of with a solid academic pedigree, and it's palpable.  I‚Äôve been completely starving for this kind of more in-depth/rigorous discussion.  I can only speak for myself, but I imagine there are many who come from a STEM/technical background who feel the same way, so thank you on our behalf.

sJXn4Cl4oww,"The overparametrization conundrum may be related to the fact we look at what NN are in a wrong way. To me NN is not a ""processor"" type of object, it's a novel type of memory object, memory which stores and retrieves data by overlaying them on top of one another & also recording the hidden relations that exist in the data set. This is what gets stored in the ""in between"" places even if the input resolution is low - the logic of coexistence of different images (arrays), which is something not visible on the surface. 
    I'm a philologist by training, and in XX cent. literature there was this big buzz around the concept of ""palimpsest"". Originally palimpsests were texts written on reused parchment from which previous text were scraped off with a razor. Despite scraping, the old text still remained under the new one, which led to having two texts in the same space on the page. In literature this became a conceptual fashion of merging two different narratives into one, with usually very surreal effect. One of the authors that comes to mind is William S.Burroughs.
    In the same way merged narratives evoke a novel situation due to novel logical interactions between the inputs, the empty space in an overparametrized NN gets filled with the logic of the world from which the input data comes & this logic exists between them even when the resolution is low.
    Maybe NN is a Platonic space. Many images of trees somehow hold in them the ""logic of the tree"", which is something deeper and non obvious to eyes, since in their form alone converge both the principles of molecular biology & the atmospheric fluid dynamics, ecosystemic interactions, up to the very astronomical effects of sun, moon, earth rotation, etc.
All of it contributes to this form in one way or another, so the form reflects those contributions & therefore holds partial logic of those interactions within it.
    Information is a relation between the object and it's context (in linguistics we say - it's dictionary). A dataset not only introduces objects, it also as a whole becomes a context (dictionary) through which each object is read. 
   In that sense maybe upscaling input data sets prior to learning is detrimental to the ""truth"" of those relations. I would be inclined to assume we'd be better off if we let the NN fill in those spaces based on the logic of the dataset, unless we want the logic of transformations to somehow influence the output data (say - we specifically are designing upscaling engine).",17,2024-04-12T18:14:45Z,False,

HOWEVER, the function modelled by the DNN has lots of inner symmetries,; it is not a ""free function"". So why does it work so well?
It is to say: when you add more layers to a neural network you can fit more complex functions with less parameters, but the shape of these functions is weird and, to some extent,  """"""""""""""""""""fractal"""""""""""""""""""". It is hard to understand why this kind of highly constrained functions fit real world relations so good. UDL explores this topic, although there is not an answer yet.",1,2024-01-04T22:47:55Z,False,

sJXn4Cl4oww,"2:01:55 I also observe a certain (well-intentioned) paternalism in Simon's opinion.

No one wants to spend the best years of their life loading boxes in a forklift or washing dishes in a restaurant, it is circumstances that push those people in that direction. I hope the day comes when human beings are freed from those chains.

On the other hand, I agree that the transition to automation can be hard, but I think we made a mistake in delegating this transition to governments. States are by nature perverse, what we need is a committed and strong civil society, with the capacity to save, that is willing to temporarily welcome those who are left out. In this sense, I believe that we can learn much more from indigenous societies, and from how anthropologists tell us that they build their social support networks, than from the social engineers who are to come.",0,2024-01-05T07:34:59Z,False,
sJXn4Cl4oww,"My favorite analogy to describe the divergence of ML & brain science is the casus of airplanes. Flying was for a long time reserved for certain products of evolution & at the beginning engineers were imagining themselves copying forms and behaviors of birds to understand them.
But in the end engineering & abstract understanding of physics behind the flying is what gave us technology that applies those principles, usually in ways very strange to nature itself. Only in recent years, due to modeling tools that came out of engineering, people begun to model bird-like, or insect-like machines & understanding how nature does it.
I like to believe ML will develop what I call ""scientific principles of thinking"", an overview of complex information processing techniques that some decades down the line will inform us on how we should look at our own brains to understand them. 
But just like with artificial bird wings, artificial human-like brains, will be nothing more then work of hobbyists and proof-of-concept academic research, since the engineered ML solutions will be that more powerful and tailored to specific tasks.
Not just neuro-mimicry, but the very ""general intelligence"" - as it is a great narcissistic dream - is also a rather useless engineering solution. What engineering problem does it solve anyway? Pretending to be human? So this would mean the current world somehow does not want humans to exist.

I'd conjecture this is the wrong way of reasoning about the prospect. LLMs will be components of systems, not a black box that is the entire system. A single forward pass through an LLM is more akin to system 1 thinking, but you can make control loops with multiple contexts and levels of reasoning to make stronger cognitive systems where the LLM is the world model and reasoning engine if put in the right framework. Also, LLMs can be extended with RAG, or access to external systems with APIs. This can also allow the model to have external memory it can store and load learned information, skills and insights into. I think the best example of this is the mindcraft bot Voyager, or possible ChatDev. Those kinds of systems being driven by SOTA LLMs is how i believe we'll fairly soon hit AGI and then ASI.",0,2024-02-23T09:53:33Z,False,

Towards the end, when Tim was asked about flipping a switch to have AI clones created of himself, the guest tried to push as much as possible while being kind, but it's dissapointing that Tim would not engage. The point of hypotheticals is to provide less ambiguous scenarios for understanding your values. As long as they're not something offensive, you absolutely must engage with them or else there is no dialogue and no point to a discussion. You also should try your best to steelman them and address the main point of the question instead of nitpicking about some contingent aspect of the hypothetical. So instead of bringing up the identity problem with cloning yourself as an issue and leaving it there, you can modify the hypothetical such that the AI isn't a clone of Tim, but rather only a clone of Tim's abilities, i.e it can do anything Tim does, but not necessarily in the same fashion.

But it's like a hidden gem!, there's a lotts and lotts of things we (newbies in LLMs) doesn't know about. I am learning how to build an LLM from scratch, I would need this video 4-5 times again in future.

9vM4p9NN0Ts,"I've just begun my education on Machine Learning, nevertheless, it is evident this video is highly, highly resourceful. The questions asked by the students were so fundamental when I, for one, at least was still grasping with basics of what was communicated. The questions in themselves helped clarify the theory on a much expansive manner. And kudos to speaker, Yann Dubois, for creating such a comprehensive manner in which this knowledge was explained - at large to such bright minds, while unknowingly educating us on YouTube as well, hahha.

I certainly will continue further reading and research. But I do hope I can figure out how to apply them as well",0,2025-02-20T15:09:54Z,False,

time 20:28 - 
Consider case prob(true_token)<(1/vocab_size), the perplexity is greater than vocab_size.
perplexity is not upper bounded by vocab_size.

9vM4p9NN0Ts,"Scaling behavior of LLM fine-tuning, emphasizes the importance of model size, task-specific considerations, and the trade-offs between different fine-tuning approaches. It highlights the need for practitioners to make informed decisions based on their specific needs and resources. As the field of LLMs continues to evolve, further research is needed to fully understand the complex interplay between model architecture, data, and fine-tuning strategies, especially at even larger scales. My research significantly contributes to the ongoing effort to develop more efficient and effective methods for adapting powerful LLMs to a wide range of downstream tasks.",0,2024-12-27T15:48:12Z,False,

9vM4p9NN0Ts,"üîç Foundational Concepts
Overview: Building Large Language Models (LLMs)
02:21 Emphasis is shifting from architecture design to data evaluation and systems in the industry.

06:25 LLMs use auto-regressive modeling ‚Äì they predict the next token based on context.

08:26 Tokenization is key ‚Äì text is broken into subword units or tokens.

12:38 Training involves massive datasets (corpus of text) to learn language patterns.

14:49‚Äì18:40 GPT-4 introduced tokenization improvements, especially for code understanding.

üìä Model Evaluation
20:31 Perplexity: Measures model uncertainty in predicting the next token.

24:18‚Äì26:15 Different evaluation techniques and prompts yield different results.

30:15‚Äì37:53 Challenges include bias, alignment, data quality, and hardware limits.

üìà Scaling Laws & Data Importance
41:38‚Äì47:21 Scaling laws show performance improves with larger data, parameters, and compute.

49:12 Data quality can matter more than architectural changes.

52:54‚Äì54:54 Inference and training are extremely resource-intensive and costly.

üîß Post-Training & Fine-Tuning
59:12 Post-training aligns the LLM for AI assistant behaviors.

1:01:05 Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is applied using curated data.

1:04:50‚Äì1:06:49 Balancing synthetic data generation with human input is critical.

üßë‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßë Human-AI Alignment
1:10:23 Human-generated data has limitations in scale and consistency.

1:12:12 Shift from cloning humans to maximizing human preferences.

1:16:06 Reward models trained with softmax logits reflect preferences.

1:18:02 Discusses optimization and modeling challenges in LLMs.

üß† RLHF and Human Feedback
1:21:49 Reinforcement Learning enhances model alignment and decision making.

1:23:44 Human annotations can be inconsistent and expensive.

1:27:21 LLMs often outperform humans in consistency with human preferences.

üìâ Limitations and Optimizations
1:29:12 Perplexity is not well-calibrated for LLMs.

1:33:00 GPT-4 performance varies based on prompt specificity.

1:34:51 Pre-training data affects initialization and model capabilities.

‚öô Hardware & Efficiency
1:38:32 Efficient GPU usage via matrix multiplication is critical.

1:40:21 Using 16-bit precision (FP16) accelerates training.

üèó Final Thoughts: Building LLMs from Scratch

eMlx5fFNoYc,"Row-by-row is actually in some sense the standard notation in Deep learning, since most (all?) popular frameworks use it internally. I'm not actually sure why, I guess it's just an old GPU programming convention. It's not uncommon for researchers to use column notation in their papers, but personally I think it might be confusing for people new to the field, as the code will almost surely treat the vectors as rows (after all, usually the first data dimension is the batch size). It's not a very significant thing of course.",2,2024-04-08T18:56:31Z,True,UgzM8apg0XNEi_-1YuR4AaABAg
eMlx5fFNoYc,"The most common association I've heard as to why there needs to be masking, is that otherwise the model could just cheat. Every word would have the same query, ""hey, what's the word after my position x?"" and then the keys would all be ""I'm at x+1"" or similar. The value at the x+1 embedding would just be the word itself, and it would know what it needs to write. Your model would always perfectly predict the next word.

This is still interesting though. What if instead of asking the model to predict the next one word, we asked it to predict the next 10? You'd implement it by sliding the triangle in the masking matrix 10 steps (masking more). Your loss would rise dramatically, since even if the model gets the ""gist"" of what it should write (like if you want it to talk about ""Harry Potter"" somewhere) it would still be off if due to sentence structure the words ""Harry Potter"" weren't in the exact same place as in the original text. You'd need to change your loss calculation to somehow focus more on the ""semantic correctness"" of those 10 words (a challenge I'm sure), but the benefit would be that the model could generate whole phrases or sentences. I'd probably do this in some staged manner, like starting with one word loss and increasing the number of words as training goes on. I'm not sure what the benefit would be though, but might be fun to try.",7,2024-04-08T20:59:00Z,True,UgzM8apg0XNEi_-1YuR4AaABAg

eMlx5fFNoYc,"*Abstract*

This video delves into the intricacies of the attention mechanism within transformers, a cornerstone technology in large language models and modern AI. It builds upon the understanding of embeddings established in the previous chapter and explores how attention refines these embeddings to incorporate contextual meaning. The video uses illustrative examples to explain the functioning of attention heads, including the concepts of queries, keys, values, and the attention pattern. It then expands on the idea of multi-headed attention and its role in capturing diverse contextual relationships. The video concludes by discussing the parameter count associated with attention and its contribution to the overall architecture of large language models.

*Summary*

*Recap on Embeddings*

* 0:00 - Transformers are key components of large language models, introduced in the 2017 paper ""Attention is All You Need"".
* 0:30 - The model aims to predict the next word in a sequence by processing input text broken down into tokens (often words or parts of words).
* 0:54 - Each token is associated with a high-dimensional vector called an embedding, where directions in this space correspond to semantic meaning.
* 1:28 - Transformers progressively adjust embeddings to encode rich contextual meaning beyond individual words.

*Motivating Examples*

* 1:40 - The attention mechanism can be challenging to grasp initially.
* 2:00 - Examples like ""mole"" in different contexts highlight the need for context-aware embeddings, as the initial embedding is the same regardless of context.
* 2:57 - Attention refines embeddings based on surrounding words; for instance, ""tower"" becomes more specific when preceded by ""Eiffel"".

*The Attention Pattern*

* 4:29 - A simplified example with the phrase ""a fluffy blue creature roamed the verdant forest"" demonstrates how adjectives update nouns through attention.
* 4:56 - Each word's initial embedding encodes its meaning and position.
* 6:14 - Nouns generate ""query"" vectors to seek relevant adjectives.
* 7:51 - ""Key"" vectors are created for each word and compared with queries using dot products to assess relevance.
* 8:59 - The resulting grid of dot products, after softmax normalization, represents the attention pattern, indicating how each word relates to others.

*Masking*

* 11:09 - During training, the model predicts the next token for various subsequences, requiring masking to prevent future tokens from influencing past predictions.
* 12:16 - Masking sets irrelevant attention pattern entries to negative infinity before softmax, resulting in zeros after normalization.

*Context Size*

* 12:42 - Attention pattern size scales with the square of the context size, making larger contexts computationally expensive.

*Values*

* 13:10 - A ""value"" matrix determines how embeddings should be updated based on relevance.
* 14:07 - Value vectors are added to embeddings based on the attention pattern weights, refining the meaning of words based on context.

*Counting Parameters*

* 15:44 - A single attention head involves key, query, and value matrices, with GPT-3 using a 128-dimensional key/query space and a 12,288-dimensional embedding space.
* 16:45 - Value matrices are factored into ""value down"" and ""value up"" matrices to improve efficiency, resulting in approximately 6.3 million parameters per head.

*Cross-Attention*

* 18:22 - Cross-attention is a variation used in models processing different data types (e.g., translation), where keys and queries come from separate datasets.

*Multiple Heads*

* 19:20 - Multi-headed attention runs multiple attention heads in parallel to capture various contextual relationships.
* 20:52 - GPT-3 uses 96 heads, each with distinct key, query, and value maps, enabling the model to learn diverse ways context affects meaning.
* 21:36 - The proposed changes from each head are summed and added to the original embedding, resulting in a refined embedding.

*The Output Matrix*

* 22:16 - In practice, ""value up"" matrices for all heads are combined into a single ""output matrix"" for efficiency.

*Going Deeper*

* 23:19 - Data flows through multiple attention blocks and other operations, allowing for increasingly nuanced and abstract encoding of information.
* 24:16 - GPT-3's 96 layers contain about 58 billion parameters devoted to attention heads, representing a significant portion of the total model parameters.

## Ending

* 24:54 - The success of attention is partly due to its parallelizability, enabling efficient computation with GPUs.
* 25:09 - Parallelizable architectures are advantageous for deep learning as model performance often improves with scale.

alfdI7S6wCY,"Notes:

Alexander Amini and Ava will instruct the ""
Introduction to Deep Learning""
(6.CS191) boot camp at MIT, lasting one week.
The course will cover foundational knowledge in deep learning, emphasizing interactive demonstrations and practical applications.
Key topics include neural network optimization, generalization methods, dropout, early stopping, and gradient descent techniques.
The program includes guest lectures and a final project pitch competition with prizes.
Course materials will be available online, and students are encouraged to engage with teaching assistants for support.
The instructors highlight the importance of continuous learning and experimentation in deep learning.

Here‚Äôs a summary of the important knowledge points covered in the MIT Introduction to Deep Learning course:

### Course Overview
- Course Title: MIT Introduction to Deep Learning (6.S191)
- Duration: One-week boot camp
- Focus: Fundamental techniques and applications of deep learning.

### Key Concepts in Deep Learning
1. What is Deep Learning?
- A subset of machine learning that utilizes neural networks to learn from data.
- Inspired by the human brains structure to learn complex patterns.

2. Intelligence Definition:
- The ability to process information to inform future decisions.

3. Machine Learning vs. Deep Learning:
- Machine learning involves algorithms that learn from data.
- Deep learning specifically uses deep neural networks.

### Neural Networks Fundamentals
1. Neurons (Perceptrons):
- Basic building blocks of neural networks.
- Perform operations through weighted inputs, a bias term, and an activation function (e.g., sigmoid, ReLU).

2. Activation Functions:
- Introduce non-linearities to the model.
- Examples include sigmoid and ReLU functions.

3. Layers in Neural Networks:
- Dense Layers: All inputs are connected to all outputs.
- Hidden Layers: Intermediate layers that transform inputs to outputs.
- Output Layers: Final layer producing predictions.

4. Training Neural Networks:
- Loss Function: Quantifies how far predictions are from actual values (e.g., cross-entropy for classification, mean squared error for regression).
- Gradient Descent: Optimization algorithm to minimize loss by adjusting weights.
- Backpropagation: Method for calculating gradients and updating weights based on loss.

### Practical Aspects
1. Data Preparation:
- Importance of having a sufficient amount of data.
- Techniques for data augmentation and cleaning.

2. Overfitting and Regularization:
- Overfitting occurs when a model learns noise in the training data rather than the actual pattern.
- Regularization techniques like Dropout and early stopping help prevent overfitting.

3. Optimization Techniques:
- Stochastic Gradient Descent: Computes gradients over random subsets (mini-batches) to speed up training.
- Adaptive Learning Rates: Algorithms like Adam adjust learning rates during training based on the optimization landscape.

4. Model Evaluation:
- Importance of evaluating models on a separate test set.
- Monitoring training vs. validation loss to prevent overfitting.

### Upcoming Topics
- Deep Sequence Modeling: Focus on architectures that handle sequential data, crucial for applications like natural language processing.

This summary encapsulates the core knowledge points from the course and serves as a reference for understanding deep learning fundamentals and practical applications.

I would say that the bright side of deep learning is on the feature extraction. In the old days, we do a lot of work to discover useful features: feature engineering.

The label Pizza is an arbitrary name given by people to it, you need the label to train the network. 

Back propgation isnt just going backwards like the video suggest, its the algorithm that actually make this Neural networks feasable from a computational possible other with it would be too slow.

So why can this deep networks can ""learn"". The root of it is convolutional Neural networks, the convolutional layer take sections of image and isolants features, where previously the feature selection was crucial for success. Knowing the correct set of convolutional Layers on the other hand is not easy, so it was the combination with Genetic Optimization algorithms that have made them effective.

q6kJ71tEYqM,"Pizza, Burgers, Tacos. A distinguishing factor between them is their breading. So a NN can learn from human supervision that a pizza image is labeled pizza because of its' carbohydrate type by visually being taught that this breading is pizza dough. Then you can train the NN to identify the ingredients of the dough by training the NN on features of labeled dough (dough such as white flour or almond flour) like their color and texture or unsupervisingly training the NN to distinguish each food's breading by their color or other external features like texture looks (golden bubbles or white flour on the breading) Then the NN can identify a pizza's carbohydrate type from being fed images of pizza dough that's labeled pizza dough manually

 In the example of pizza, burgers, and tacos, if a NN is fed a labeled data set of different yellows and gold, and outputs the correct answer to the human input, then the NN's training on colors can be used to identify the dough type,

5NgNicANyqM,"Want to clarify for those hard of understanding on the arc matrixes and sudoku, that 

(linear programming) Action1 has cost1 because of X1 Math, A2C2X2, etc =

A contains:   B contains:
                    
[ X                   [  X
Y                     Y
Z  ]                 Z ]

These are two separate matrices so duplicates are okay, if they are both nested into a single matrix than they cannot contain the same so if A = XYZ, and B = ABC but I want to switch A = X with B = C I have to backtrack to get than switched so that anything afterword can have it's proper Alignment (If I am on D I have to go all the way back to B and switch)

This counts as An Action1/Cost1/X1 move for example, if your AI was trying to cycle through all the matrices and properly align them.
The reason that you don't want duplicates in a single matrix is the same as in geometry that a straight line is the shortest path between towns, If I start From:

X then Y then Z it is in sequence, If I reverse it, it's still in sequence. But if I change X then Z Then Y, (Z) is in the center meaning I must go from X to Y to Z (sequence), then back to Y, because I had to pass through Y to get to Z in the middle anyway. (like I need to go to Walmart, Mcdonalds, and Kohls but I go to kohls first so I have to drive all the way back to Mcdonalds etc etc)

Everything else was pretty good for such a long video very precise but that part got a little repeat confusing I think.

BTW, since this is all costly one should use both breadth and depth - first searches with A* to get to the goal faster from both directions, so that things like this matrix can be solved with inference (if A = XYZ THEN C must = ABC) faster, in order to produce sequential inference actions faster. It's If, Then logic is what inference means: If A, then B.",2,2024-10-24T19:06:36Z,False,

The Gini impurity is a measure of how often a randomly chosen element from the set would be incorrectly labeled if it was randomly labeled according to the distribution of labels in the subset. The Gini impurity can be computed by summing the probability of each item being chosen times the probability of a mistake in categorizing that item. It reaches its minimum (zero) when all cases in the node fall into a single target category.

In the case of the Iris dataset, the root node contains all the instances, and if they are evenly distributed among the three classes (setosa, versicolor, virginica), the Gini impurity will be 0.667. This is because the probability of choosing an instance from any class is 1/3, and the probability of misclassifying it is 2/3 (since there are two other classes). The calculation is as follows:

Gini Impurity = 1 - (1/3)^2 - (1/3)^2 - (1/3)^2 = 0.667

This indicates that there is a 66.7% chance of misclassifying a randomly chosen element from the dataset if it was labeled according to the distribution of labels in the entire dataset.

The code you provided is plotting the decision tree. The Gini impurity for each node is calculated during the creation of the decision tree, not during the plotting. The Gini impurity is shown on the plot for each node.",22,2023-12-12T12:27:39Z,False,

JxgmHe2NyeY,"I have a question around 1:25:40. You mentioned that we use Lasso to avoid less important features. The lower the slope, the lower is the modulus of that slope (or theta). 
If I consider the mathematical definition, 
in L2 Regularization: Cost is is J(theta) + lambda (sum of squares of thetas)
and in L1 Regularization: Cost is is J(theta) + lambda (sum of modulus of thetas)
So, if the absolute value of the slope is less than one, the square of it would be lesser, and hence we would be able to discard that feature more prominently.

When we're talking about getting slope closer to zero. It is definitely in between 0 and 1. So squaring them in ridge will definitely make them smaller. So I dont get the explanation that you're giving.
Can we say that for a feature when it is not that useful, while computing lasso cost function(say LCF), LCF increases faster due to mod values of slopes(in between 0 and 1) but the ridge cost function(RCF) increases slowly as the squared values of slope will decrease the increasing rate of RCF? Here I am talking about the change in LCF and RCF with respect to increasing lambda values.
So, the Lasso will give optimal slope equal to zero when lambda is increased. But Ridge might not give zero slope even with higher lambdas due to slowly increasing rcf wrt increasing lambdas.

To learn more about the AI in the video, keep reading! 

These agents we're quite tricky to train. Despite the task being simple, we actually had to do a good amount of reward shaping in order to get interesting behavior. The agents are punished for dying, being in the air (to discourage spam jumping, which was the bane of my existence for a while), the ball being on the agents side, the ball not being held and being close to the ball while the ball is lethal. The agents are also rewarded for hitting the opponent with a throw, picking up the ball for the first time (otherwise they would just push the ball back and forth), throwing the ball while in the air (to get the speed boost) and being close to the ball while it's ready to be picked up.

It was a massive challenge training the agents in the final room, largely due to the fact that it seemed as though no matter what we did, the Kai's would just spam jump when there were more than a couple balls on their side, finally Andrew had the great realization the reason for that is to try to avoid the friendly fire that happens when you have 10 agents on one side lol, so we disabled friendly fire on the final battle and tried resuming the training considering we already had 50m steps trained, the behavior wasn't perfect but it looked pretty cool and we've already kept you guys waiting for a video for too long we decided to use it! I hope it meets your guys standards!

Tyler built the demo you can download on our discord server and it's absolutely awesome, you get to play as Albert and try to beat Kai, who has the brain that was trained in the first room and is REALLY hard to beat ahaha, make sure to check it out! We're hoping to release a demo like this for each video we upload so the wait between videos doesn't feel as long

These videos are really challenging to make, especially quickly, which is why there are so few videos on this channel, but thanks to our team and support from our community discord server (seriously you should join it) we're really on our way to uploading monthly, I'm 99% sure we'll get another video out to you guys within a month!

We're hiring game developers!! If you're skilled in Unity and art and want to be a part of what we're doing, please apply though the link: https://forms.gle/AXGF1t2F8mxKk6316 :)

LPZh9BOjkQs,"@@lilposs98 imagine a neural network as a factory of workers (neurons or nodes). Each line of workers performs a specific function (layers), let‚Äôs say the entire factories job is to sort images of cats and dogs. To speed up the process, the first worker line gets the raw photos, the following lines are responsible for identifying certain features in the photo (pointy ear, long nose, whiskers, etc). The workers collaborate and pass their results onto the next line. The very last line of workers (output layer), decide whether, based on all the results, the photo was of a cat or dog. Now at first the workers arnt very good at this and sometimes get confused, so the manager (training algorithm) comes in and says ‚Äúu called this cat but it was dog, let me adjust how much u care about pointy ears‚Äù. The manager tweaks how much all the workers care about certain feature and the results coming from other worker lines (weights and bias), until they get really good at identifying stuff.

But it is out of the world if you know how to interpret this knowledge to your own workflows, otherwise you will find it quite normal.

I am a bachelor student on Electrical and Mechanical engineering, I am close to apply to a CSE masters. While doing my thesis project, I needed to perform several simulations. After taking this certification everything clicks in so quickly. Watching workflows on PDE, optimization schemes and so for, everything just makes sense I am never stuck. Take in consideration that my previous education did not taught at all how to implement the theory learn to research or industrial scientific computing approaches. 

Also, take in consideration that I have previously researched on state of the art deep learning, so the more 'crazy' machine learnings (conv nets and so for) parts of this course where much easier to assimilate for me.

Anyway this course gave a really good starting point in how to implement that (machine learning/deep learning) on physical systems. My previous research was on semantic approaches exclusively (computer vision).

It is great! Also it is really easy to get a 15% discount.

So knowledge wise it is great. Now certificate vale wise, and going to find out in a few months. I am going to apply to a CSE masters as I mentioned and I wonder if this certification is seen just as another fancier coursera/edx course. It definitely more than that, but how academics view it is totally different. At least now. Industry wise I have no clue.",7,2021-03-17T04:59:32Z,True,UgyOfSltP4nw4RBBEil4AaABAg

v3UBlEJDXR0,"This 8 minute video took over 100 hours to make! Everything in the video (except for the music) was created entirely by me using Unity, so please, like and subscribe!:D

If you're interested in training your own AI like Albert but don't know how, there's now a really easy way to do it! Luda, an AI lab, recently built a web app that allows you to create and train your own AI using deep reinforcement learning (just like Albert) completely for free in your browser! You build your own character (called a Mel) with lego-like building blocks then watch it train in real-time on their website in just a few minutes (really). It's an awesome project, and just like my videos, makes deep reinforcement learning so much more accessible, which is why I love it so much. This section of the comment is sponsored by Luda, but these words are entirely my own, it's an amazing project that I would have been obsessed with had they released it before I built Albert. I've genuinely been looking for a sandbox/game exactly like this since I was a kid. They're still early, but they're giving my audience first access to their closed, pre-alpha build. Make sure you check out their site and create an AI agent for yourself!:D https://prealpha.mels.ai


Now, back to Albert:

Time it Took to Train:
Room 1: 10 minutes
Room 2: 20 minutes
Room 3: 29 minutes
Room 4: 48 minutes
Room 5: 5 hours 42 minutes

Total Training Time: 7 hours 29 minutes

*NOTE* You only see one Albert in the video, but there are actually around 50-100 copies of Albert and the room he's in behind the camera training simultaneously. This makes it so instead of me needing to go through 500 hours of footage to edit the video, I only need to go through 7.

Albert was trained using reinforcement learning, meaning he was rewarded for doing things correctly (like hitting a pressure plate), and punished for doing them incorrectly (like falling off the platform or hitting a wall/obstacle). After Albert finishes each attempt, the actions he took are analyzed and the weights in the neural network (Albert's brain) are adjusted using PPO (proximal policy optimization) to prioritize the actions that lead to a positive outcome, and to avoid the actions that lead to a negative outcome.

All of Albert's inputs is his 'vision', which comes from raycasts. There are a total of 21 raycasts, 7 looking down, 7 looking straight ahead and 7 above his head, all with a maximum FOV of 70 degrees to try to mimic our own vision. Each of these raycasts is responsible for 2 inputs for Albert's neural network; the distance to an object (if any), and the type of object it is (pressure plate, obstacle, ground). I also stacked Albert's vision 6 times so he can have some sort of short term memory, he can find a pressure plate in the room then take actions to get towards it even if it's no longer visible (for a little bit).

If you're still reading this, you're probably really smart and want to learn more about Albert, so make sure to join my discord server I just made where we can talk more about the details of Albert's AI! https://discord.gg/jM2WkNuBnG :)

In the first room Albert starts off randomly making moves until he accidentally hits the pressure plate to open the door, giving him a reward. This reward made the neural network controlling his actions update to try to replicate that outcome, and this continued with each pressure plate until Albert opened the door and was able to walk (on an invisible pressure plate) in the next room. Once Albert got into the next room, the same process was repeated, continuing with the same neural network that let Albert escape the previous room.

For people who think I faked this:
It would probably take me longer to fake this than it would to just do it for real, I used Unity's ML-Agents toolkit to make it easy, though I have experimented before with doing everything from scratch (poorly). The reason this AI is a lot smoother than others you've probably seen is because I only allow the AI to make a decision every 10 academy steps (game ticks), so when it starts to turn for example, it's forced to keep turning that way for 10 ticks. I did this because I don't like how jittery the AI looks when you let it make decisions every tick. Also, you only see one AI in the video, but behind the camera there are roughly 50-100 copies of Albert and the room he's in that train simultaneously to speed up the training process. The reason I opted for this over having them all train in the same room is because I wanted to be able to follow a single character for the sake of the video. Albert uses the same neural network the entire time, all you need to do is add ""--resume"" to the end of the command when training in Unity to have it continue using the same brain. Unity's ML-Agents makes AI quite easy!

xk8wHY1AFpI,"Everyone seemed to really love the video of Albert learning to walk, so I thought I would make a video improving that walk! In this video Albert starts with the brain he developed in the walking video, and he uses that knowledge to learn how to climb up and down stairs, walk on uneven terrain, drop off ledges and even climb up a backwards escalator! Albert is getting better and better:D

If you‚Äôre interested in learning more about exactly how Albert works, I‚Äôll do my best to explain it here in a simple (but correct) way, but this explanation is nothing compared to what you would learn going through the ‚ÄúIntroduction to Neural Networks‚Äù course on Brilliant. Despite them sponsoring the video, they‚Äôre not paying me to write this comment, I‚Äôm writing this because the course is genuinely the best introduction to neural networks (like Albert) I‚Äôve seen, and access to all their courses is completely free for 30-days if you use my link Brilliant.org/AIWarehouse to sign up for a free trial. The 30-day free trial would give you plenty of time to get through the relevant courses ‚ÄúIntroduction to Neural Networks‚Äù, ‚ÄúReinforcement Learning‚Äù and ‚ÄúArtificial Neural Networks‚Äù completely for free:) It's also a great way to support the channel, as you know it takes months to make these videos, and just starting a free trial using Brilliant.org/AIWarehouse would help me out so much! Anyway, onto how Albert works!

If you're interested in training your own AI like Albert but don't know how, there's now a really easy way to do it! Luda, an AI lab, recently built a web app that allows you to create and train your own AI using deep reinforcement learning (just like Albert) completely for free in your browser! You build your own character (called a Mel) with lego-like building blocks then watch it train in real-time on their website in just a few minutes (really). It's an awesome project, and just like my videos, makes deep reinforcement learning so much more accessible, which is why I love it so much. This section of the comment is sponsored by Luda, but these words are entirely my own, it's an amazing project that I would have been obsessed with had they released it before I built Albert. I've genuinely been looking for a sandbox/game exactly like this since I was a kid. They're still early, but they're giving my audience first access to their closed dev build. Make sure you check out their site and create an AI agent for yourself!:D https://prealpha.mels.ai

NOTE: It may look like there‚Äôs only one Albert training, but there are actually an additional 280 Alberts training simultaneously behind the camera to speed up the training time (and also reduce the amount of footage we need to sift through).


HOW THE BRAIN WORKS
I‚Äôve explained this in previous videos, but Albert is controlled by an artificial brain called a neural network. His brain has 5 layers, the first layer consists of the inputs (the information Albert is given before taking action, like his limb positions and velocities), the last layer tells him what actions to take and the middle 3 layers, called hidden layers, are where the calculations are performed to convert the inputs into actions.

Albert starts off using his brain we trained in the walking video, and we use reinforcement learning to further train his brain for this new task of climbing stairs. The only things that matter when it comes to deep reinforcement learning (reinforcement learning with a multi-layered neural network) are figuring out what information to give the agent (the observations/inputs), and when and how much to reward and punish it (the reward function). Almost all of Albert‚Äôs inputs are exactly the same as the inputs we gave him for the walking video (like the position, rotation, velocity, angular velocity, strength and contacts for each limb, plus some sensor observations), in this video however, we also have a sensor sticking out in front of each foot which tells Albert the distance between his feet and the stair in front of him, if there is one. These sensors are the only way Albert can ‚Äòsee‚Äô, and they only detect stairs, so Albert is essentially blind!

Just like in the last videos, Albert was trained using reinforcement learning. For each of Albert's attempts, we calculate a score for how 'good' he performed and use an algorithm called proximal policy optimization (PPO) to make small, calculated adjustments to his brain to try to encourage the behaviors that led to a higher score and avoid those that led to a lower score. You can think of increasing Albert‚Äôs score as rewarding him and decreasing his score as punishing him, or you can think about it like natural selection where the best-performing Alberts are most likely to reproduce, so the genes that lead to better behavior will get more prevalent with each generation. As long as the reward function (how we reward/punish Albert) is set up robustly, these small adjustments to Albert‚Äôs brain over (sometimes) hundreds of millions of attempts leads to Albert getting very good at completing the goal defined by the reward function (climbing up and down stairs).


REWARD FUNCTION
Climbing up and down stairs is very comparable to walking so most of the heavy lifting for the reward function was done in the video where Albert learns to walk. In that video, I had to deduce exactly how and when to reward/punish Albert to get him to take steps, so for this video, I used that same reward function to encourage Albert to continue taking steps, just with one additional punishment; punishing Albert when he stands too still. I‚Äôll get into why I had to add this reward in a couple of paragraphs. The reason we have levels for Albert that increase in difficulty is because if we were to throw Albert onto the escalator with only his knowledge of walking, he would have no hope of coming even close to getting through the course since he would need to learn many very complex motions to make even a little bit of progress.

Also, I just made a community discord server! If you want more updates on Albert and learn more about exactly how he works (and just talk AI in general), make sure to join! https://discord.gg/jM2WkNuBnG :)

The first level is as simple as we can make it; just a few single steps. These steps are designed specifically to make Albert trip, that way he‚Äôll eventually learn to associate detecting the step with a new environment that needs a different behavior. Albert (and reinforcement learning agents in general) tend to learn to do whatever is easiest while still improving their scores. In this case, Albert originally realized it‚Äôs easy to just stop walking and stand still when he detects a stair, and when he does that he no longer trips and falls over the stairs, so just standing still is the easiest way for him to get a higher score. That‚Äôs why we added the additional punishment for standing still, we pushed him so he stops getting stuck in that local maximum reward. After doing that he was much more willing to try to step over the stairs and sure enough, after a bit of time, was able to do it consistently.


OBSERVATIONS
As mentioned above, we give Albert the same information we gave him in the walking video (limb positions, rotations, velocities etc.), except this time we give him 2 additional observations in the form of sensors coming out of his feet to detect stairs in front of him. Giving him these 2 new observations means I had to retrain Albert‚Äôs walking from scratch with 2 additional null inputs, then continue the training on this new brain, since otherwise there wouldn‚Äôt be any room on the input layer to give him the sensor data. Thankfully, since the walking behavior had a very carefully modeled reward function and I didn't need to record the training, it didn't take long for my computer to train it again from scratch (about 45 minutes). Adding new observations to this stair-climbing brain would be much more laborious since I would need to train each room at a time. While the walking AI didn‚Äôt actually need all the rooms to train properly, this one did.


FINAL CHALLENGE
The final room was very hard for Albert and unfortunately I ran into a big issue I didn't anticipate. I realized too late that since Albert is only given the distance to the ground under his feet and the distance from his feet to the stairs in front of him (if there are any), he isn't able to differentiate normal stairs and the escalator, but the motion required is very different, so it makes it impossible for him to only use one brain. I didn't plan on making him go up an escalator, that was an idea I had later on in the development, and because of that, in the final run he actually uses 2 different brains, he uses his main stair brain until he hits the escalator, then uses the escalator brain, then when he reaches the top of the escalator, I swapped it back to his main brain. There is definitely a way to have one brain work for the entirety of the final room, all that's needed is to give him an extra observation of whether or not the stair in front of him is moving, that would have trained the escalator behaviour into the main brain, unfortunately I just didn't have time to re-train everything to make this work, since it already took 3 months to make the video lol.

We can either predict p, a continuous value between 0 and 1, or we can predict the outcome, itself, which is in {0,1}.  The former is regression; the latter is classification.  Logistic regression predicts that probability p and logistic classification takes that probability and uses a cutoff (sometimes, but not always, 0.5) to predict the outcome.  Many times, the probability is more important (for example, lots of the same type of customer -> you do not want to assume all of them are 1's, when p is estimated to be 0.6) and sometimes the outcome is more important (for example, making a decision to approve an application for credit.)",139,2022-03-10T19:51:42Z,False,

yN7ypxC7838,"Interesting how many people in the comments call Logistic Regression a regression model... Logistic Regression outputs a category, not a continuous value. To understand deeper:

Logistic Regression = Linear Regression + Sigmoid (or SoftMax for multi-class) + Unit Step function

Thus, for the binary case, imagine the prediction of the linear regression (a continuous value from -infinity to +infinity) that is than squeezed into the range of 0 to 1, which is not a straightforward probability, but we can interpret it that way. Lastly, a unit step function is applied (the threshold), which makes the prediction categorical.

So, while part of it outputs continuous values, the final outputs is categorical and Logistic Regression is always used as a classification model in the literature.",2,2024-09-02T23:10:04Z,False,

00:00 *ü§ñ Introduction to Machine Learning Models*
- Supervised learning models map inputs to outputs based on example pairs, such as predicting shoe size based on age.
- There are two subcategories of supervised learning: regression and classification.
- Regression models find a target value based on independent predictors, like the relationship between age and shoe size.
00:57 *üìà Regression Models*
- Regression models have a continuous output and are used to find relationships between dependent and independent variables.
- Common types of regression models include linear regression, multiple linear regression, and polynomial regression.
- Linear regression finds a line that fits the data, while multiple linear regression finds a plane of best fit and polynomial regression finds a curve of best fit.
01:01:24 *üå≤ Decision Trees and Random Forests*
- Decision trees are models with nodes, and the more nodes, the more accurate the tree.
- Random forests are ensemble learning techniques that build off of decision trees.
- Random forests create multiple decision trees using bootstrap data sets and randomly selecting subsets of variables, reducing the risk of error.
02:00:06 *üß† Neural Networks*
- Neural networks are multi-layered models inspired by the human brain.
- They consist of nodes (neurons) and connections between them.
- Neural networks can be used for various tasks, including image recognition and natural language processing.
02:06 *üß† Neural Networks and Classification Models*
- Neural networks are multi-layered models inspired by the human brain, with input, hidden, and output layers.
- Classification models have a discrete output and are used to categorize data into distinct classes.
- Common types of classification models include logistic regression, support vector machines, and Naive Bayes.
03:35 *unsupervised learning ‚ùÑÔ∏è Unsupervised Learning*
- Unsupervised learning draws inferences and finds patterns from input data without labeled outcomes.
- Two main methods in unsupervised learning are clustering and dimensionality reduction.
- Clustering groups data points and is used for customer segmentation, fraud detection, and document classification.
04:02 *üìä Clustering and Dimensionality Reduction*
- Common clustering techniques include k-means clustering, hierarchical clustering, mean-shift clustering, and density-based clustering.
- Dimensionality reduction reduces the number of features in a dataset.
- Principal component analysis (PCA) is a popular dimensionality reduction method.

L_4BPjLBF4E,"In every ‚ÄúAI learns to walk‚Äù video I‚Äôve seen, the AI either learns to walk in a weird, non-human way, or they use motion capture of a real person walking and simply train the AI to imitate that. I thought it was weird that nobody tried to train it to walk properly from scratch (without any external data), so I wanted to give it a shot! That‚Äôs what I said 4 months ago. It‚Äôs been really difficult, but I‚Äôve finally managed to do it, so please watch the whole video! The final result ended up being awesome :)

If you're interested in training your own AI like Albert but don't know how, there's now a really easy way to do it! Luda, an AI lab, recently built a web app that allows you to create and train your own AI using deep reinforcement learning (just like Albert) completely for free in your browser! You build your own character (called a Mel) with lego-like building blocks then watch it train in real-time on their website in just a few minutes (really). It's an awesome project, and just like my videos, makes deep reinforcement learning so much more accessible, which is why I love it so much. This section of the comment is sponsored by Luda, but these words are entirely my own, it's an amazing project that I would have been obsessed with had they released it before I built Albert. I've genuinely been looking for a sandbox/game exactly like this since I was a kid. They're still early, but they're giving my audience first access to their closed, pre-alpha build. Make sure you check out their site and create an AI agent for yourself!:D https://prealpha.mels.ai


Now, back to Albert:

NOTE: You can only see one Albert, but there are actually 200 copies of Albert and the room he‚Äôs in training behind the camera to speed up the training.

If you want to learn more about how Albert actually works, you can read the rest of this very long comment I wrote explaining exactly how I trained him! (and please let the video play in the background while reading so YouTube will show Albert to more people)


THE BASICS
I created everything using Unity and ML-Agents. Albert is controlled entirely by an artificial brain (neural network) which has 5 layers, the first layer consists of the inputs (the information Albert is given before taking action, like his limb positions and velocities), the last layer tells him what actions to take and the middle 3 layers, called hidden layers, are where the calculations are performed to convert the inputs into actions. His brain was trained using the standard algorithm in reinforcement learning; proximal policy optimization (PPO).

For each of Albert‚Äôs limbs I‚Äôve given him (as an input) the position, velocity, angular velocity, contacts (if it‚Äôs touching the ground, wall or obstacle) and the strength applied to it. I‚Äôve also given him the distance from each foot to the ground, direction of the closest target, the direction his body‚Äôs moving, his body‚Äôs velocity, the distance from his chest to his feet and the amount of time one foot has been in front of the other. As for his actions, we allow Albert to control each body part‚Äôs rotation and strength (with some limitations so his arm can‚Äôt bend backwards, for example).

Just like the last videos, Albert was trained using reinforcement learning. For each of Albert's attempts, we calculate a score for how 'good' it was and make small, calculated adjustments to his brain to try to encourage the behaviors that led to a higher score and avoid those that led to a lower score. You can think of increasing Albert‚Äôs score as rewarding him and decreasing his score as punishing him, or you can think about it like natural selection where the best performing Alberts are most likely to reproduce. For this video there are 13 different types of rewards (ways to calculate Albert's score), we start off with only a couple and with each new room add more, always in an attempt to get him to walk.


REWARD FUNCTION
Room 1: We start off very simple in the first room, we reward him based on how much he moved to the target and we punish him for moving in the wrong direction. This led to Albert doing the worm towards the target, since he figured out that was the easiest way for him to move the quickest/get the highest score.

Room 2: In the second room we start checking if his limbs hit the ground. If the limb that hits the ground is a foot we reward him (but only if it's in front of his other foot, more on that later), if it isn‚Äôt, we punish him. I also made it so Albert wasn‚Äôt rewarded at all unless his chest was high enough to force it to at least be partially standing. As seen in the video, this encourages him to not fall over and encourages him to use his feet to do it. We also introduced a new reward designed to encourage smoother movement; if he approaches the maximum strength allowed on a limb he's punished, and he's rewarded if he uses a strength of almost 0. This encourages him to opt for the more human-like movement of using a bit of strength from many limbs as opposed to a lot of strength from one limb.

Room 3: This is where we start to polish Albert‚Äôs gait that developed in room 2 and teach him to turn. From here on we start using the chest height calculation as another direct reward where the higher his chest is the more he‚Äôs rewarded in an attempt to get him to stand up as straight as possible. These rewards so far give Albert a decent gait, however he‚Äôs still not using both of his feet (which was by far the hardest part of this project), so room 4 is designed to do exactly that.

Room 4: We get Albert to take more steps from a few additional rewards. To start, we introduce a 2 second timer that resets when one foot goes in front of the other. We reward Albert whenever this timer is above 0 (the front foot has been in front for < 2 seconds), and we punish him whenever the timer goes below 0 (the front foot has been in front > 2 seconds). We add another reward proportional to the distance of his steps to encourage him to take larger steps. To smooth out the movement, we also add a punishment every frame proportional to the difference in his body‚Äôs velocity from the previous frame to the current frame, so if he‚Äôs moving at a perfectly consistent velocity he isn‚Äôt punished at all, and if he makes very quick erratic movements he‚Äôs punished a lot.

If you're still reading this, you're probably really smart and want to learn more about Albert, so make sure to join my discord server I just made where we can talk more about the details of Albert's AI! https://discord.gg/jM2WkNuBnG :)

Room 5: For the final room the only change I made to the reward function was to go back to an earlier version of a reward. Throughout the other rooms I had been tinkering with how I should reward Albert‚Äôs feet being grounded, my initial thought was to only reward the front foot for being grounded to try to get him to put more weight on his front foot when taking steps, but somewhere along the way I changed it to just rewarding Albert for any foot being grounded, and that was the version Albert trained with in rooms 3 and 4. For this final room I switched back to the old front foot grounded reward which resulted in a much nicer looking walk. Also, the video makes it seem like I never reset Albert‚Äôs brain, that isn't entirely true, I had to occasionally reset it because of something called decaying plasticity.


OTHER
For rooms 1 to 4 I only allowed Albert to make a decision every 5 game ticks, but for the final room I removed that constraint and let him make decisions every frame. I found if Albert makes a decision every game tick it‚Äôs too difficult for him to commit to any proper movements, he ends up just making very small movements like slightly pushing his front foot forward when he should be taking a full step. The 5 game tick decision time forces him to commit to his decision for at least 5 game ticks so he ends up being more careful when moving a limb. When I recorded him beating the final room I removed this limitation because he‚Äôs already learned to commit to his actions so allowing him to make a decision every tick just results in a smoother motion.

L'esprit humain est beau et il  n'adopte que ce qui est beau.
Ce qui √©merveille l'esprit humain n'est pas ce que la duplication des faits et gestes par le produit de nos inventions nous livrons √† la communaut√©, mais c'est irr√©m√©diablement ce doit pouvoir l'invention concevoir et mat√©rialiser et/ou accomplir dans le processus de la vie individuelle et collective.
L'√™tre humain apprend pour s'armer de savoir et de savoir faire dans le but de r√©ussir √† se pr√©munir contre les dangers futurs. Sa source reste son compl√©mentaire semblable et autres, telles ses sources d'√©nergies et autres cr√©atures partageant son environnement d'existence.
L'intelligence artificielle se pratique par l'art d'inventer afin d'imiter des √™tres vivants dans leur existence.
Il est donc vain d'appeler cela de l'intelligence .
On parle d'IA quand on s'appuie sur son capital exp√©rience pour concevoir et inventer le n√©cessaire √† la r√©ponse √† un besoin personnel ou bien collectif.
L'invention ne peut concevoir comme peut le faire l'√™tre vivant qui lui a √©t√© cr√©√© dans l'environnement propice √† toutes les conceptions constructives et destructives.
L'√™tre humain ne peut qualifier son semblable d'intelligent car il lui est diff√©rent et compl√©mentaire par le capital exp√©rience dans sa vie.Deux √™tre humains ont les m√™mes outils d'existence et des exp√©riences compl√©mentaires.De quelles intelligence pouvons nous les taxer, puisqu'ils restent incomparables?
La pr√©occupation de l'√™tre vivant reste celle de changer de pr√©sent pour vivre le futur et/ou le pass√©, en arr√™tant son temps pour le red√©marrer ailleurs .
Il veut aussi prendre contacte avec les extra-terrestres qui ne peuvent √™tre contact√©s que s'ils existent dans l'environnement identique √† celui de ceux qui tuent des enfants et des femmes pour les d√©pouiller de leur ressources de vie, bien que travaillant dans laboratoires de recherche comme ceux d'Europe et d'Am√©rique.
L'intelligence artificielle est le cheval de batailles des enfants qui naissent dans des bars, qui se font √©lever dans des orphelinats pendant 18 ans pour √™tre lib√©r√©s afin de se faire √©lire et se venger des peuples pacifiques d'Afrique et du moyen orient.",1,2021-08-17T11:42:21Z,True,Ugzlbnhhsxu77xWTJ614AaABAg

VyWAvY2CF9c,"Some (hopefully constructive) annotations to improve the video for better clarity:

* 6:33 - ""Channels have weight"". And the slide matches it. But 7:08 says the weight is something of a neuron (how important is the neuron, rather than how important is the relationship). I think it is confusing; aren't weights a property of the relationship/channel, in graph theory?
* inside slides that list advantages/disadvantages you might use the color red for disadvantages, and not just always green to highlight terms. Ex. ""small"" at 29:08.
* I like the examples of descending the Everest, and the one about memorising songs.
* 40:21 - the slides disappears till 40:57
* same at 52:01; till 53:11
* 58:15 - ""sometimes you may find the ???? depicted over time"" (the automatic subtitles don't get it either)
* 1:04:17 - audio says ""input gate, output gate, and a forget gate""; but the slides shows ""Update, Reset & Forget gates"".
* 1:10:30 - ""although if you are interested I'll leave them in the notes below""; yet, it would be useful if a list (or a link to more info) could be added in the description.

These are the major notes that I think should be fixed, for better clarity.
Anyway it is well made, a good explanatory overview of the neural networks world, that I had no idea about it.

It was ok to understand for me, if I skip on the name of the specific algorithms (that in the end are implementation details).

VyWAvY2CF9c,"0:10 The computer runs an algorithm on each players possible moves and picks the one that's closest to the king WITHOUT BEING EATEN. 

There is no ai in that. It's just iterating all the players and iterating all of their moves going from player to player. 

There are actually many moves to remember and remembering all of them on a move can be sometimes difficult when there are so many possibilities

A computers algorithm in that framework is 100% correct all of of the time.

In terms of the facial ai it's just objects which are outlined and marked with a set of attributes

Trigonometry is really important here. 

Also business functions play here quite frequently

It's also remembering situations and figuring out the best path I took at a path. 

A path is a set of steps I took. How many times has that played up before. 

What were the moves that won me the game at that path. 

That's the hard part. That's deep learning. That's path memory. Very difficult 

This is where you learn to flip the binary tree on its side and use them as open ports. 

Drawing it differently and analyzing is all we need to see.

Calling neural network nodes ""neurons"" misleads people into thinking you are actually trying to imitate a neuron instead of just using a software node. Stating that activation functions are non-linear is not always correct - in fact the equation you showed when you said that looks like a linear sum of terms.

7eh4d6sabA0,"What I find fascinating is how schools struggle to teach kids because the teachers hate their job and don't want to be there along with the students, but you go to YouTube and you find enthusiastic, detailed, videos along with people who legitamently want to help people learn. 

Then turn around and teach others how to do what they were taut and all that for the low low price of a like, comment and subscribe. I learn and use very very little of what I learned in school, but I know and learned so much more from YouTube. I know alot about Python, HTML, and Unity, SQL Database, Hacking, Pentation testing, building, home repair, car repair, and robotics ALL OF IT from YouTube not school.

2:09:19 Mean squared error (MSE) is a quadratic loss function used for regression tasks.

2:14:34 Mean squared error penalizes outliers, resulting in a major shift in the regression line.

2:25:48 The first step is to assign values to columns indicating good, bad, and neutral.

2:30:57 Today's session covered the topic of optimizers in deep learning

2:41:59 Using gradient descent for training deep learning models with large datasets requires extensive resources.

2:47:12 Mini batch stochastic gradient descent improves convergence and reduces resource complexity

2:58:01 Exponential weighted average is a technique to smooth data and give more importance to previous values.

3:03:19 Exponential Moving Average for Smoothing Curve in Gradient Descent

3:14:04 The value will decrease as the timestamp goes

3:19:14 Exponential weighted average helps control learning rate increase

3:30:53 Implementing artificial neural network using TensorFlow GPU and reading dataset

3:36:09 Predict whether a customer will exit a bank or not.

3:46:21 Perform train test split and feature scaling

3:51:57 Using standard scalar to transform data

4:02:26 Dropout layer is used in neural networks to reduce overfitting.

4:07:21 Neural network training process with dense layers and Adam optimizer.

4:17:25 Early stopping helps to automatically stop the training process when the monitored metric stops improving

4:22:52 You can generate a confusion matrix and calculate the accuracy for the test data.

4:33:46 We will be discussing about convolution neural network (CNN) in this session.

4:39:31 Visual cortex has multiple layers responsible for different tasks

4:49:52 Convolution operation explained

4:54:53 The calculation results in a pattern of zeros and negative numbers.

5:05:30 Padding prevents loss of information during convolution operation.

5:10:48 Padding and activation function are important in convolutional operations

5:21:46 Extract the highest numbers from each output

I had some problems on the first model training  at the 4h43m of your video. I'm Now on the TF version 2.15.0 and i had to change the model.fit(X,y,epochs=5),
changing the X Expanding his dim tf.expand_dims(X,axis=1)
it only works when i use like this:
model.fit(tf.expand_dims(X,axis=1),y,epochs=5)

###EDITED### 13/01/2024
as i walk on the trainning video i get more insights of how the model works and it came up to me that, if you want to use the one dimension training data X, you have to be explitcit passing the kwarg when you're adding the first input layer ""input_shape=[1]"":

A lonely tensor, floating through space,

Yearning for a companion, a partner of its own.

It performs its tasks with diligence and care,
But all the while, a deep loneliness it can't bare.

It longs for connection, a bond that's true,
A fellow tensor, to share its math with, new.

jmmW0F0biz0,"Honestly, I find the architecture of ANN to be too complex. I'm thinking about this in therms of combined probabilities. Not sure if this applies to algorithms, but I suppose it has to. More layers, more chances of getting errors that need corrections and end up needing additional steps to correct them. Basically, operations at the processor level to ensure the stability of the machine. I noticed something like this while doing CFD computations. There, there is this rule of thumb that it's best to distribute no more than 200000 cells on each processor for best computational speed. But I don't think this takes into account the complexity of the computation and the operations involved. As in, distribution computations that do a lot of addition is different than distribution computations that do a lot of multiplying. Simply because of that combined probability thing that gives you to some extent the overall number of operations required to assure the stability of the machine. So... What can I say... Every time I look at an ANN I'm thinking... That thing is unstable af. I was thinking of trying some different models, but I haven't done it yet. Instead of passing data from neuron to neuron, just defining a function that adds the numbers and does some trick on them to get to the same result. Something in the realms of Fermi approximations. Not really sure. Instead of doing all the computations node by node, just try devising a system that simply relies on the multitude of simple operations that cancel the errors out and get a good result. Have no idea, haven't tried it yet. I think I will, but I'm not sure of the results. But AAN, really unstable stuff. Also, I totally dislike benchmarks. Those things don't consider in any way the errors produced by complexity theory. So you use one of those, decide the computer is really good for what you want to do and in practice... Not so much. Cause I've noticed this on CFD. When you choose the number of processors to use, if you just apply the rule of thumbs, you don't take into account in any way the architecture of the computer, how the data between processors is distributed (assuming you use a cluster), stuff like that. And all of these things combined... Might not be that important in the end, maybe end up saving 5% cpu time, who knows? All I know is that I don't trust benchmark tests for determining how good a computer is for a certain type of simulation. What can I say... I saw a lot ofe memes with people praying that the server doesn't crash during holly days. This whole combined probability thing might actually be the reason for that happening.",0,2025-01-27T06:09:03Z,False,
